# Project Report
> Your project report should document the three phases of your project. There is no specific length
requirement. Include enough information for the instructor to understand what your did, and what
the results were. Include code-snippets as needed, but don’t just fill the document with code.
Your report should be complete. At the same time, please consider:
Brevity is the soul of wit / In der Kürze liegt die Würze / Omit needless words

## Phase 1: Create map data
- During this initial phase of the project, all of the group members collected data as explained in the guidelines


## Phase 2: Test existing algorithms
- Phase 2 was containing the most workload. We decided not to just copy-paste and adapt the existing algorithms from the course repository, but seeked to understand the underlying concept, re-implementing them by our own.
- We've initially split up the development of each algorithm across the group members. With the time being, all the implementations ended up being a group effort, however.
- All of us grasped the concepts of the Depth-First and the Breadth-First pretty fast. To understand the concepts behind the Best-First and the A* algorithm, some more time was required.

## Phase 3: New or adapted algorithm
